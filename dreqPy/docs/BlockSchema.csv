label	__core__:label	Record Label	A single word,  with restricted character set	__core__	xs:string		rdf:property	A short mnemonic word which is potentially meaningful but also concise and suitable for use in a programming environment.
uid	__core__:uid	Record Identifier	Unique identifier	__core__	xs:string		rdf:property	Must be unique in the data request. For well known concepts this may be related to the label, but for items such as simple links between concepts an  a random string will be used.

All records in the schema definition section must have class set to ''__core__''.	__core__	xs:string		rdf:property	The useClass declared for an attribute can affect its interpretation in the Python package. For example, attributes labelled as “useClass=internalLink” should refer to another data request record.
type	__core__:type	Record Type	The type specifies the XSD value type constraint,  e.g. xs:string.	__core__	xs:string		rdfs:range	Used in the XSD schema to constrain attribute values.
techNote	__core__:techNote	Technical Note	Additional technical information which can be used to specify additional properties.	__core__	xs:string		rdf:property	
superclass	__core__:superclass	Superclass	States what class the property is derived from	__core__	xs:string		rdf:property	
id	__core__:id	Alternative identifier	Alternative identifier	__core__	xs:string		rdf:property	For sections, the id provides a short alias for the section label.

maxOccurs	__core__:maxOccurs	Maximum number of permissible occurrences of this section	Maximum number of permissible occurrences of this section	__core__	xs:string		rdf:property	Used in defining sections. In the CMIP6 Data Request each section only occurs once.
